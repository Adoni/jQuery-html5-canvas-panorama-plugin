<Q & A>

Q. Why do you re-create already existing jQuery panorama plugin?

Yeah, it's another jQuery panorama plugin!

But the implementation details are quite different. 

As the repo name implies, it internally changes image into html5 canvas.
Users can drag and view 360 degree panorama through the canvas.



Q. Why canvas? Aren't image with css and javascript sufficient?

Probably correct. I chose html5 canvas for two reasons:

1. If we draw things on canvas, we can do pretty cool stuffs with it like applying cool effects on it.

2. Drawing things on html5 canvas is fast enough on today's mobile device.

(I want this plugin get spread :D So I added the last but not least important notes)

*. It scrolls smoothly(maybe smoother than others)
*. It scrolls like iOS scrollview



Q. So what's the jQuery plugin name? jQuery-html5-canvas-panorama?

No, that's too long. Because it's jQuery plugin, it should start with "j".

But I prefer "dd", which means "dance dance". So the name is "ddpanorama"
Strange enough, but this is named after an amateur photograph's blog I love
I want to support that photos being displayed on the web
I'll create a series of tools and plugins to support Let's dance! :D



Q. What is jquery.ba-outside-events? Is it part of the plugin?

No, absolutely not. It's a prerequisite jQuery plugin which handles outside events ex) outside mouse release event

It's a simple and works good. The author's page is here(http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/)

Maybe later it can be included in jQuery itself! Check the new version if you have a time.

I included "jquery.ba-outside-events.min.js" file in the repository which works currently with ddpanorama.
