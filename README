jQuery-html5-canvas-panorama-plugin

Q. Why do you re-create already existing jQuery panorama plugin?

Yeah, it's another jQuery panorama plugin!

But the implementation details are quite different. 

As the repo name implies, it internally changes image into html5 canvas.
Users can drag and view 360 degree panorama through the canvas.



Q. Why canvas? Aren't image with css with js sufficient?

Probably correct. I chose html5 canvas for two reasons:

1. If we draw things on canvas, we can do pretty cool stuffs with it like applying cool effects on it.

2. Drawing things on html5 canvas is fast enough on today's mobile device.



Q. So what's the jQuery plugin name? jQuery-html5-canvas-panorama?



No, that's too long. Because it's jQuery plugin, it should start with "j".

But I prefer "dd", which means "dance dance". So the name is "ddpanorama"
Strange, but this is named after one amateur photograph's blog I love. 
I want to support this one's photo's on web. 
I think I'll create a series of tools and plugins to support this one.
